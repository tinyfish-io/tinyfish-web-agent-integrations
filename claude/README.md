# TinyFish

The complete web toolkit for your agent — search, fetch, browser automation, and headless browser control.

## Skills

All built on TinyFish's hosted MCP server (bundled via `.mcp.json`). No install, no CLI needed — first use triggers an OAuth sign-in to your TinyFish account (requires an account with available credits). Works in any environment, including sandboxed surfaces without terminal access.

## Authentication

Two ways in, no configuration to choose between:

- **API key** — set `TINYFISH_API_KEY` in your environment (`tinyfish auth login` does this for you) and the plugin sends it as `X-API-Key`. No browser sign-in.
- **OAuth** — with no key set, or a key the server rejects, the connection falls back to the OAuth sign-in prompt.

- **`/tinyfish:search`** — free, token-efficient web search with flexible recency/date filtering and news/research-paper scoping
- **`/tinyfish:fetch`** — free, clean content extraction from up to 10 URLs in parallel, including JS-heavy pages
- **`/tinyfish:agent`** — browser automation (600 free automation credits for new users, then your plan's credits): natural-language goals, batch runs across multiple sites, and raw CDP browser sessions

## Desktop setup note

In Claude Desktop, installing this plugin enables its skills but the bundled `tinyfish` MCP connector still needs one manual step: open the plugin's **Connectors** tab and click **Install** on `tinyfish` before the skills can actually call it.

## Local file access

None of these skills read local files. All operations go through the TinyFish MCP server.
